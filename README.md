# JobMon
The Jobs Monitor processes emails from various job boards including JobServe. The filtering provided by job boards is not great - either the filters are too lax and the emails contain too many job ads to read, or the filters are too strict and you get hardly any job ads. JobMon allows you to set up much more criteria: jobs which pass the JobMon set of filtering criteria are stored in a database. When the user reviews jobs in the database, criteria can be updated.
